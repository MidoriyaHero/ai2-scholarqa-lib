## Why Asta Failed for Q2

### Problem 1: Wrong Approach
- Q2 asks "What are techniques?" - requires **comprehensive extraction**
- Asta searched for papers about techniques (same as Q1)
- Should have: Prioritized survey papers and extracted their taxonomy

### Problem 2: Quote Extraction Insufficient
- Only 5/19 papers (26.3%) had technique quotes
- Quotes were implementation details from specific papers
- Not comprehensive technique lists

### Problem 3: No Organization
- 5 techniques mentioned scattered across papers
- No categorization
- No taxonomy structure

### Problem 4: Missing Survey Extraction
- Asta found papers but didn't deeply extract from surveys
- Human strategy: Read surveys specifically to extract techniques
- Surveys have organized taxonomies - Asta didn't leverage this

### Problem 5: Single Source
- Only searched academic papers
- Missed practical techniques from Medium, GitHub, industry blogs
- RAG techniques, chunking strategies mostly from web sources

## Human Search Process (Actual Steps)

### Step 1: Recognize Q2 is answered by Q1 
```
Thought: "Q2 asks for techniques. Q1 found survey papers.
         Surveys contain technique lists. Don't need new search!"
```

### Step 2: Access Q1 survey papers 
```
Open "Beyond the Limits" survey (arXiv:2402.02244)
Open "Context Engineering" survey (arXiv:2507.13334)
Ready to extract
```

### Step 3: Read Survey 1 comprehensively 
```
Read Section 3: Length Extrapolation
        Extract: RoPE, ALiBi, xPOS, CLEX, YaRN, PI, StreamingLLM
Read Section 4: Attention Approximation
        Extract: Longformer, Linformer, Performer, RetNet, CosFormer
Read Section 5: Attention-free Transformers
        Extract: S4, Mamba, Hyena, H3, HIPPO
Read Section 6: Model Compression
        Extract: GPTQ, AWQ, LLM.int8, MQA, GQA
Read Section 7: Hardware-aware
        Extract: FlashAttention 1/2/3, Ring Attention, PagedAttention
```

### Step 4: Read Survey 2 for additional techniques 
```
Read "Context Engineering" survey
Extract: Memory management techniques
Extract: Reasoning strategies (CoT, Long CoT, Self-reflection)
Extract: Tool integration methods
```

### Step 5: Search web sources for practical methods 
```
Query: site:medium.com RAG chunking strategies
Found: Optimal chunk size ~1,800 chars, overlapping chunks
Query: site:github.com awesome LLM long context
Found: RAPTOR, LongRAG, AttentionRAG
Query: site:databricks.com long context techniques
Found: Retrieval reordering, lost-in-middle fixes
Compiled web techniques
```

### Step 6: Organize all techniques 
```
Group by category:
        - Academic techniques from surveys
        - Practical techniques from web
        - Create 11 categories
Final count: 90+ techniques
```

## Exact Search Queries Used

### For Q2, I Did NOT Do New Searches!

**Key Insight:** Q2 is answered by Q1 survey papers.

**My actual process:**
1. ✅ Reused survey papers from Q1
2. ✅ Read surveys deeply (not just abstracts)
3. ✅ Extracted complete technique taxonomies
4. ✅ Supplemented with Q1 web sources (Medium, GitHub)

**Only additional query:**
```
site:medium.com RAG chunking strategies optimal
```
→ Found practical chunking guidelines

**Contrast with Asta:**
- Asta did a completely NEW search for Q2
- Found 19 different papers
- Wasted 3 minutes on redundant search
- Got worse results (5 techniques vs 90+)

## Recommendations

### For Asta to Answer Q2-type Questions

**Q2 is fundamentally different from Q1:**
- Q1: "Find papers" → Search papers
- Q2: "What are techniques?" → Extract from papers

**Asta should:**

1. **Detect question type**
```python
def is_extraction_question(query: str) -> bool:
    extraction_keywords = [
        "what are", "list", "techniques", "methods",
        "approaches", "strategies", "how to"
    ]
    return any(kw in query.lower() for kw in extraction_keywords)
```

2. **Different pipeline for extraction questions**
```python
if is_extraction_question(query):
    # Step 1: Find survey papers (prioritize surveys)
    surveys = find_surveys(query)

    # Step 2: Extract techniques from surveys
    techniques = extract_from_surveys(surveys)

    # Step 3: Organize by category
    organized = organize_by_category(techniques)

    # Step 4: Supplement with web sources
    web_techniques = search_web(query)
    organized.extend(web_techniques)

    return organized
else:
    # Regular paper search pipeline
    return search_papers(query)
```

3. **Survey prioritization**
- Detect survey papers (title contains "survey", "review")
- Boost surveys to top of results
- Extract structured content from surveys (sections, taxonomies)

4. **Taxonomy extraction**
- Parse survey structure (sections, subsections)
- Extract technique names + descriptions
- Preserve categorization

5. **Multi-source for extraction**
- Academic: Survey papers
- Practical: Medium, GitHub
- Industry: Company blogs
- Combine all sources

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Question Type Matters
- Q1 (finding papers) requires **search**
- Q2 (extracting techniques) requires **reading + extraction**
- Same tool (Asta) failed both, but for different reasons

### 2. Surveys Are Gold for Extraction
- Surveys contain organized technique lists
- Don't need to search new papers for Q2
- Just read Q1 surveys deeply

### 3. Efficiency Through Reuse
- Human: Recognized Q2 answered by Q1 results
- Asta: Redundantly searched for new papers
- Reuse saves time and improves quality

### 4. Organization Is Critical
- 90 techniques without organization = useless
- 11 categories make techniques findable
- Taxonomy enables understanding

### 5. Validation Prevents Hallucination
- Easy to list technique names
- Hard to ensure they're real
- Human validated each technique against sources
